GitHub is a version control tool, it will help us track everyone's changes and include (merge) them into the final version when they are ready.  

1. Follow the steps on https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/ to set up Git. Under "Set Up Git", you should be able to select the platform you're working on (Mac/Windows/Linux). If you're using Mac or Windows, you can download a GUI to simplify the process:

Mac: https://mac.github.com/
Windows: https://windows.github.com

1. On GitHub.com, browse to the EPDnM-TQM/web-tutorial repository.

2. On the top right, press "Fork". This will create a copy of the files for you to work on locally.

3. Open the GUI, click on the (+) on the top left, press the "Clone" tab and select the EPDnM-TQM/web-tutorial fork that you created on the previous step. Follow the instructions to save a copy on your machine. 

4. If you navigate to this fork on the GUI, it will show you a list of the changes that have already been made to it. You can now work on these files. 

5. It is highly recommended that you save (commit) your changes regularly. To do this in a controlled way, save your changes and browse to the "Changes" tab in the GUI. Tick the changes that you want to commit, write a summary and a description at the bottom of the page, then click "Commit to master".
