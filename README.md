Web-based Tutorial Resource for TQM Assignment.

GitHub is a version control tool, it will help us track everyone's changes and include (merge) them into the final version when they are ready.  

1. Follow the steps on https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/ to set up Git. Under "Set Up Git", you should be able to select the platform you're working on (Mac/Windows/Linux). If you're using Mac or Windows, you can download a GUI to simplify the process:

Mac: https://mac.github.com/
Windows: https://windows.github.com

1. On GitHub.com, browse to the EPDnM-TQM/web-tutorial repository.

2. On the top right, press "Fork". This will create a copy of the files for you to work on locally.

3. Open the GUI, click on the (+) on the top left, press the "Clone" tab and select the EPDnM-TQM/web-tutorial fork that you created on the previous step. Follow the instructions to save a copy on your machine. 

4. If you navigate to this fork on the GUI, the "History" tab will show you a list of the changes that have already been made to it. You can now work on these files. 

5. It is highly recommended that you save (commit) your changes regularly. To do this in a controlled way, save your changes and browse to the "Changes" tab in the GUI. Tick the changes that you want to commit, write a summary and a description at the bottom of the page, then click "Commit to master".

6. After a few commits, you might want to add your changes to the "master" (the final copy that we'll submit). To do this, click on the "Sync" button at the top right of the GUI. Then go back to the GitHub website, go to your Profile page, and you should find the Forked repository in the "Repositories" tab. Follow the link to it. On the top left, you should find a green button with two arrows. Click on it and a new page should open with a summary of your changes. Press on the green button "Create Pull Request". Here you can add a summary and a description of the work that you did. Then click on the green button "Create Pull Request" again. 

7. Your changes will then be revised and merged to the master if they do not break the work of others.
