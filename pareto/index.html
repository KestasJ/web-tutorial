            <h1>Pareto</h1>
            <h2>Pareto principle</h2>

            <p>The Pareto principle suggests that most effects come from relatively
            few causes. Inquantitative terms: 80% of the problems come from 20% of 
            the causes (machines, raw materials, operators etc.); 80% of the wealth 
            is owned by 20% of the people etc. Therefore effort aimed at the right 
            20% can solve 80% of the problems. Double (back to back) Pareto charts 
            can be used to compare 'before and after' situations. General use, to 
            decide where to apply initial effort for maximum effect. </p>

            <h2>Pareto chart</h2>

            <p>Pareto chart is one of the seven basic graphical tools for quality
            control which is named after an Italian economist, Vilfredo Pareto. A 
            Pareto chart is a type of chart that contains both bars and a line 
            graph. Data are represented in descending order of their importance by 
            the bar chart on the left vertical axis, generally by magnitude of 
            frequency, cost, time or other important unit of measure. The 
            cumulative percentage total is represented by the line graph on the 
            right vertical axis which forms a concave function due to the way of 
            which the data are ordered. An example of Pareto chart is shown in 
            Figure 1 below: </p>

            <p>The chart presents the information being examined in its order of
            priority and focus attention on the most critical issues. The chart 
            aids the decision-making process because it puts issues into an easily 
            understood framework in which relationships and relative contributions 
            are clearly evident.</p>
